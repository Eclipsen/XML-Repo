# Project Apex XML Repo

This is a public repository for the creation and error checking of XML files.

### Important:

If you want an XML making for your map. File an Issue using our [Issue Tracker][]

### Do:

-   Submit your requests for an XML to be made.

-   Submit a download link to a map

-   Include pictures with your request *(Within reason, Max of 3!)*

### Do not:

-   Expect your request to be fulfilled instantly. We are real people, and have real lives

-   Spam your request for a map XML to be written, it will decrease the chances that we will actually do it

## Formatting

It is recommended that issues are formatted using the following template for maximum clarity and readability:

### Title

Provide a brief summary of the map. Your title should allow users browsing the repo to grasp the gist of your map at a glance.

**Example**:

> Scorched Grove - DTM 75v75 - Eclipsen & i2

### Description

Try to separate your description into three different sections, if possible:

1.  **Map Name**

    What is the Map's name?

2.  **Gamemode**

    What game mode is the map? Rage, Blitz, DTM, Etc...
    
3.  **Map Specific XML Settings**
    
    What special regions need to be protected, should TNT block damage be disabled, Etc...

4.  **Authors**

    Who made the map? Include any relevant contributors.

5.  **Extra Information**

    Information that doesn't necessarily fit into any other sections. Common examples are attachments, images, or disclaimers.
